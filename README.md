# Admind Dashboard

The Admind Dashboard is the final project of the intermediate HTML and CSS session of The Odin Project. The main focus of the Dashboard is to test my ability to navigate the grid tool of css to make a cohesive layout.


## Objectives
### Layout
- [x]  Writing out the HTML elements for the sidebar, header and main-content containers.
- [x]  Apply Grid properties using CSS until you have this basic layout built.

### Nesting
- [x]  Taking it one section at a time, begin nesting child elements under the parent elements in the HTML. Remember that you can keep making grid containers within grid containers.
- [ ]  In the sidebar, use more grids to lay out the navigation and branding sections.
- [ ]  In the header, use more grids to lay out the search bar, user info and buttons.
- [ ]  For the main-content, use more grids to lay out the projects, announcements and trending items.
- [ ]  Fill out some dummy content and placeholder images so you can position all of your grid items.
