# Admind Dashboard

The Admind Dashboard is the final project of the intermediate HTML and CSS session of The Odin Project. The main focus of the Dashboard is to test my ability to navigate the grid tool of css to make a cohesive layout.


## Objectives
### Layout
- [ ]  Writing out the HTML elements for the sidebar, header and main-content containers.
- [ ]  Apply Grid properties using CSS until you have this basic layout built.
